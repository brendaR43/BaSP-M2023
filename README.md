# Become a Software Professional 2023

## Week 01
We worked on a figma prototype, we designed a website for a gym called "Mega Rocket Gym".

## Week 02
We created an HTML document with the same content as the landing of the screenflow of the first week.

## Week 03
We included the styles corresponding to the HTML structure of week 02 to make the page look identical to the first week's screenflow landing page in desktop view.

## Week 04
We replicated the landing page of the screenflow of Week-01, using Flexbox to create a responsive design following the Mobile first concept.
